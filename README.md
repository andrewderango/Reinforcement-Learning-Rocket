# Rocket Landing with Genetic Programming

This project implements a genetic programming approach to land a rocket at a specified point in a simulated virtual physics environment by controlling its rocket thrusts. It utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to evolve a population of expression trees that represent control policies for the rocket.
